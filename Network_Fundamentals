Open Standard Interconnection (OSI) and TCP/IP models

OSI model pricipally serves as tool for explaining networking concepts and troubleshooting.

                                                Flow Control 

TCP handles the Flow control through the process called windowing. the two end devices negotiate the window size when 
initially establishing the connection; and then renegotiate the window size during the life of connection, 
increasing the size until it reaches the maximum windows size of 65,535 or until error occure.


                                                  Connection establishment

Connection establishment between two devices is the process of initializing sequence and acknowledgement fields and agreeing 
port number and window size.

UDP  is connectionless protocol :)



TCP/IP Internet layer 

1. The web client sends an HTTP request.

2. TCP encapsulates the HTTP request.

3. IP encapsulates the transport segment into a packet, adding source and destination addresses.

4. Lower layers process and send the request to the web server.

5. The web server receives HTTP requests and sends a TCP acknowledgment back to the requesting web client.

6. The web server sends the HTTP response down to the transport layer.

7. TCP encapsulates the HTTP data.

8. IP encapsulates the transport segment into a packet, adding source and destination addresses.

9. Lower layers process and send the response to the requesting web client.

10. The requesting web client sends an acknowledgment back to the web server.





DEVICES

Switches  - Switching, security and segment

1. Access Switches  - Facilitate the connection of end device to the network.
2. Distribution switches - Recive data from Access switches and forward the data to Core switches.
3. Core switches - Backbone, will handle majority of data in switching LAN.


Routers - Primary devices to interconnect network like LAN , WAN and WLAN.
