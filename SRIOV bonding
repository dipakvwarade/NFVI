the only way to get VFs belonging to 2 different PFs on the same VLAN is to create 2 distinct networks with distinct provider:physical_network and physical_device_mappings set to the different PFs.
nova's mentality of not exposing hypervisor details to the user: one won't be able to to choose the exact PF.

trust on vf is by default trust off i.e instance os cant overwrite libvirt's mac which result in not beeing able to move a MAC from one port to another during interface failure resulting in bond failure.
yet it can be set manually # ip link set dev < device > vf <vf> trust on   
Another option is to use fail_over_mac.
